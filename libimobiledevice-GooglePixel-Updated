Absolutely—I’ve done the homework and found a solid, ready-to-use solution that will automate building and installing the entire iDevice stack properly on your Pixel Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based). This will eliminate the guesswork and half-baked steps.

## Use a Community-Built Installer Script

There's a **community-maintained installer script** on GitHub called `libimobiledevice-installer` by **nightness**. It automates the fetching, building, and installation of all required components—**libplist, libusbmuxd, libimobiledevice, usbmuxd, idevicerestore, ifuse**, and more—in the correct order. It's exactly the type of comprehensive solution you need.
([GitHub][1])

### Highlights:

* Handles dependencies and repository setup automatically.
* Ensures all components are built and installed in the right sequence.
* Designed for Debian/Ubuntu variants, which matches your Pixel Linux setup.
* Includes everything from core libraries to handy tools (e.g., ideviceinstaller, ifuse).

You can check the `build-debian.sh` script here:
([GitHub][2])

## How to Use It

Here’s how to get it working on your system:

```bash
# Install prerequisites
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config

# Clone the installer repo
git clone https://github.com/nightness/libimobiledevice-installer.git
cd libimobiledevice-installer

# Run the Debian automatic builder
chmod +x build-debian.sh
./build-debian.sh
```

This script will:

1. Clone each needed library/tool.
2. Build them in the correct dependency order.
3. Install them system-wide via `make install`.
4. Resolve the version mismatches (like upgrading libplist ≥ 2.6.0) automatically.

---

## Why This Fixes Your Troubles

* **Solves your libplist version issue**: The script automatically fetches a new enough version (≥ 2.6.0) and installs it properly, satisfying requirements for downstream libraries like libtatsu.
  ([GitHub][3], [Debian Packages][4])

* **Handles libimobiledevice glue and usbmuxd**: Builds and installs the glue and communication libraries before building the main `libimobiledevice`.
  ([GitHub][5])

* **Runs everything in the correct sequence**, so there are no missing Makefiles or configure failures like you've seen.

## Next Steps

1. Give the script a try using the instructions above.
2. If you encounter any errors during its execution, send me the log/output.
3. I’ll help troubleshoot specifics—whether that's environment variables, pkg-config paths, or linking issues peculiar to your Pixel Linux setup.

Let me know when it's done or if anything pops up—I’ve got your back!
